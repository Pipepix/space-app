Planet Dibutino appeals to audiences of all ages, from school-age children to adults. (though only adults who still carry a little dreamer inside, so, let's just say it's intended for children.)

The application tells a story themed to "The Little Prince" and anticipates the moral of its ending. The Little Prince neglected his asteroid, which led to an invasion by the Baobabs. What you have to do is to dream up a new planet for him.

Through the interactivity of the application, we help children understand how different variables (such as gravity, distance from their parent star, and orbital radius) influence life on a planet. The game makes users manipulate each variable to create their planet. Depending on the values they assign to each one, the result will be either a habitable planet or a "try again." Of course, we have generated a general report that will provide the user who failed the challenge with possible reasons why their planet may not have been habitable and the opportunity to try again. Whereas, if the user successfully overcame the challenge, the report shown will be accompanied by gratitude from the Little Prince. Both reports are based on astrobiological concepts with words that are understandable for all audiences. In essence, Planeta Dibutino works with the user on science as much as it works on the imagination required to tackle the challenges that life on another planet presents.
