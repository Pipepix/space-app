            <p>Pay attention to the following:

                An excessively high gravity would not allow us to walk, while, with an excessively low one, we would not have an atmosphere capable of protecting us.
                <br><br>
                A planet very close to the parent star would be very hot, and one very far away would be very cold. Neither of them would have liquid water.
                <br><br>
                Planets with very eccentric (oval) orbits reach very extreme temperatures depending on the season.
